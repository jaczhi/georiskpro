Esri Intern Hackathon 2023: Team 11 Submission

When user plans a trip for any destination, this app determines the risk of a natural hazard occurrence (volcanoes, earthquake, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, etc.) for a particular month in any location in the United States. A travel route is created, and users receive information regarding when their travel route passes through areas with low, medium, high or severe risk for natural hazards.  
We built the web application by using typescript, python, spatial analysis and ArcGIS Pro, Experience Builder, ArcGIS Runtime SDK for JavaScript.
